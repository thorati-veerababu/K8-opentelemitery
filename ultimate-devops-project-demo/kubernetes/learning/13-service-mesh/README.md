# 🕸️ Service Mesh (General)

A Service Mesh (like Istio or Linkerd) manages traffic between services.

## 📌 Key Features
1.  **mTLS**: Mutual TLS encryption between all pods automatically.
2.  **Traffic Shifting**: Canary deployments (send 10% traffic to v2).
3.  **Observability**: Tracing requests across microservices.

## 🛠️ Installation
Installing a mesh is complex. This folder is a placeholder. Common tools:
*   `istioctl install`
*   `linkerd install`
